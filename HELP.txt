blockip

   Safely prevents hosts reaching this machine. 

usage:

   blockip <options> host

Options:

    --config-file <file>    use <file> as config file. Default: ./blockip.static 
    --debug                 print debugging output
    --dry-run               run through all the checks, but don't (un)block
    --example-config        print out an example blockip.conf
    --help                  see this help
    --iptables              use iptables for block/unblock (overrides config file)
    --list                  print known blocks
    --config-help           see config file help
    --no-prompt             don't prompt for confirmation (for scripts)
    --unblock               unblock IP address

The unblocking may not work; it assumes that the IP address has been blocked
in the same way as blockip is configured to (see 'block_command' and 
'unblock_command' in the config file).


blockip has two configuration files. blockip.static is provided by the 
package manager, and should not be edited by anybody else. It contains just a 
whitelist and confirm-first list.

blockip.conf is for normal human consumption, and may contain all config 
options. It is created on package installation. You can recreate it with

blockip --example-config > /etc/blockip/blockip.conf
