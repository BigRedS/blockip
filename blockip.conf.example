# block_command and unblock_command are executed when blocking and unblocking 
# an address, respectively. The default is to use `ip route add blackhole` and 
# `ip route del blackhole`
# There is one available variable, %ip_address%, which is the address to be 
# blocked or re-permitted:

#block_command = ip route add blackhole %ip_address%
#unblock_command = ip route del blackhole %ip_address%

cache_dir = /var/cache/blockip

# The whitelist and confirm-before list must come *after* any other directives.
#
# Each is a list of elements of the form
#
# <address> = <name>
#
# Where <address> may be an IP address, a network in CIDR notation, or a DNS 
# name. The 'name' is simply a string used to tell a user why they ought not 
# delete this address.

# Whitelisted addresses may not be blocked. RFC1918 and loopback ones are 
# hardcoded into the script:
#  [whitelist]
#  1.2.3.4 = Example address

# Confirm-first addresses may be blocked, but the user will first be prompted
# with the label given here, in case that makes them change their mind. They
# are intended for things like search engine bots:
#  [confirm-first]
#  216.58.213.100 = Google Bot
